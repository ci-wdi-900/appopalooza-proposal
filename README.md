# Riffy - Proposal

### Introduction

Today you're going to plan out a node app of your very own design. Then you'll get started. But not without a plan! That is due first.


### The Basics

You'll be making a node app that uses `readline` to take in input and `console.log` to provide output. And you get to pick what it does! There are some suggestions at the bottom of this readme, but you can _absolutely_ do something else. We'll be presenting these, so put your best foot forward!


### The big requirement

Whatever you make, it has to have a followup question. (Or seven.)

### Workflow

Do not fork this repo. Simply **create your own repo** called "[app name]-proposal" and craft your plan as the README.md file.


### Your Planning Process

What we want for this planning phase is a plan/proposal/outline with the following sections:

* App Summary - what your app will do. Write it as if you're describing it to a lay person. Don't care about node or JavaScript; just what your app does for the user. The one for [Color Cleaver](https://github.com/ci-wdi-900/color-cleaver-front-end) (remember that one?) might be, "Tells the user which colors combine to make their chosen color, or what color the colors they choose combine to make."
* App Logic - HOW your app does it. Color Cleaver's would discuss how it has a different if check for each color or pair of colors, and how it decides to combine or break apart depending on how many colors the user inputs.
* Stretch Goals - your own ideas for where you could take this app. Think of this as the ambitious version of your app. For Color Cleaver, it might mean being able to handle non-primary and non-secondary colors, or giving html color codes, or finding colors that work together into a palette. Be **very** ambitious here-- if you complete these goals, you weren't ambitious enough!


### Some Possible Apps To Make

Please feel free to use these ideas as jumping off points to something else, or expand them to something more challenging. In fact, please make the best, most feature-filled version of whatever you're doing. Now and always.

Please and thank you.

* Number Guessing Game

This app takes in numbered guesses until the user gets it right. It calculates a random integer (check out `Math.random()`!) from 1 to the number of your choosing  and then checks it against the given guess, letting the user know whether they guessed correctly! Then it keeps letting them guess until they get it right (or quit).

* Word Guessing Game

This app takes in strings and tries them against hard-coded answers. It might, for example, see if you can guess the birth-year of a particular celebrity by typing in their name and a year. Or which dinosaurs lived in which periods. Or anything like that that you know (or could look up) the answer to. It should have followup questions, as well. For example, maybe tell them whether they guessed too high or low on Zendaya's birthday. Help them narrow it down!


* Currency Converter

Let the user choose what currency they want to convert to and from, and then let them convert after that. $400 USD in Kenyan Shillings? Great, now what's that result in yen?

* Bill Split Calculator

This app asks for an overall bill, a tip percentage, and how many ways to split it, in three separate questions, and then calculates how much each party owes. For a really good version of this, you'd want to follow up with a chance to edit things if they get it wrong, or give them a chance to tip more if they don't tip enough.

* Choose Your Own Adventure.

### Other Ideas

Run ANYTHING else you want to do by us! As long as it uses some branching logic and isn't overly ambitious, we'll okay it! (We might even okay it even if it IS overly ambitious. Be brave!)
